  Annual Term Exam Essay (Class XI)

We looked at the sky and instantly knew this was going to happen. The murky skies of September were quite evident and proved their power on the most important day. The light shower and swaying of trees well indicated a heavy downpour. Even though the blue sky played hide and seek behind the opaque black clouds, the drizzling rain continued.

My mother was invited to give a lecture in one of the most esteemed institutes of Geography, Bangalore University. My mother always takes me as her company during a long distance trips. I was equally enthralled by the thought of enjoying a marvelous lecture delivered by my mother in front of the audience and the various academic processes I will learn through the interactions. 

We arrived at the airport a little before clock ticks twelve noon. The waiting time was long as we didn't want to participate in any activities as we thought the onboarding may start any time. We sat and chatted over multifaceted topics with expert opinions from my mother. Eventually we got bored and the wait tired us. Our drowsiness broke as we got up startled when we heard the news. 

The flight has been delayed due to poor weather conditions. The fact that it would be four hours late made us visibly unhappy. Our much anticipation was drawing down and excitement dwindled.

But we found the solution. We roamed here and there to get a feel of the place. The exorbitantly high-pricing shops in the airport had exquisite items prominently displayed on the shelves. It was much better to look at than the saddening drops of water from the sky. The items had varied colours and intricate designs which made us spellbound. The souvenirs like rings and pens were drawing heavy attraction from the foreigners.

Waiting tirelessly we stopped at the cafeteria. The smell of hot coffee was enough to instigate us to buy four of them. We also had sandwiches as our snacks apart from our own.

We eventually found solace as we walked through the bookstore isles. Our favourite authors were sitting on the shelves ready to be picked up and read. It killed most of our time and boredom as we delved into the mesmerizing holiday story books. It was a real adventure to walk alongside the splendid narration.

It didn’t stop us from clicking our selfies at the most favorable spots i.e a large golden bird which perhaps symbolizes the long-lost glory of India taken by the British. We did not waste a single nanosecond to post them on my mother’s Facebook wall (page). 

The equally hopeless and depressed fellow passengers craving for the flight were delighted and engaged with us on the topic of weather in Geography. This also cut short the last interval of waiting until the flight eventually showed itself in a seemingly grand entrance.

Our experience did not die, even after we crossed the folding gates of the aircraft. It etched on us the memorable tricks to avoid boredom and fascinate ourselves with trivial notions. This taught us how to explore and keep ourselves enthralled in the most serene environments. This is the most effective survival technique that I have known till now.
