Hey there! I'm a quantum computing enthusiast currently navigating the challenges of 12th grade.

Quantum physics has always been my passion, and I'm excited to share my journey with you through this blog. From delving into quantum algorithms to experimenting with cutting-edge quantum hardware, I'll be documenting every step of my adventure. 

But don't worry, I believe learning should be fun, so expect a light-hearted approach. While I'm still in high school, my aspirations extend beyond the classroom. I'm eager to dive into research and development in the quantum world.
